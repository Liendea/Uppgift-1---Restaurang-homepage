        <h2 class="italic">Our Story</h2>
        <h4 class="italic">From Passion to Plate</h4>
        <p>
          Our story began with a simple but powerful idea: to create a dining
          experience that nourishes both the body and the planet. It started
          with a love for fresh, plant-based food and a desire to build a
          better, more sustainable future through what we eat. At Botanique, our
          journey is one of purpose, passion, and connection to nature.
        </p>
        <h4 class="italic">A Seed Is Planted</h4>
        <p>
          In the early days, our founder, Tobieaux Rhênvallé, envisioned a place
          where plant-based food wasn’t just about being healthy—it was about
          being delicious, meaningful, and kind to the planet and animals. After
          years of working in the culinary world and witnessing the impact of
          traditional food production, Tobieaux knew it was time to change the
          way people thought about dining. So, we planted the seed for something
          new—an eatery that celebrates seasonal ingredients, supports local
          farmers, and creates dishes that are full of flavor and compassion.
